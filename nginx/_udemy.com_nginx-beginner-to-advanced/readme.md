## S04 Getting Started with NginX

### S04/L18 Installing Nginx on Docker (new)

```
docker --version
docker images
docker run -dit 80:80 centos:6 /bin/bash
docker ps
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```
container:
```
npm -qa | grep nginx
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install nginx

service nginx status
service nginx start
cd /etc/nginx
vi nginx.conf
# exit
service nginx status
netstat -ntlp
# running on port 80
CTRL+P and Q  # exit container
docker ps
```
browser:
```
127.0.0.1
# default nginx page
```

**Modify host file:**

`c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 example.com
```

### S04/L19 Understanding NGINX Architecture (New)

- NginX Configuration File
- Master Process
  - Reads the configuration file
  - Launches Worker processes
- Worker Processes
  - Responsible for interaction with the clients

#### worker_processes

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
worker_processes auto;    # the amount of worker processes, depends on CPU core number
```
console:
```
ps -ef --forest | grep nginx
nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
\_ nginx: worker process
\_ nginx: worker process

cat /proc/cpuinfo
# number of processors
```

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
worker_processes 4;
```
console:
```
service nginx reload
ps -ef --forest | grep nginx
# 4 worker processes
```

#### user

- not related with the master process
- defines which user of worker processes start with

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
user nginx;               # will be inherited by worker processes
```

Master process will start with the user that starts the service (e.g. `root` user in this case).

console:
```
ps -ef --forest | grep nginx
root  ... nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
nginx ... \_ nginx: worker process
nginx ... \_ nginx: worker process
```

#### error_log

`/var/log/nginx/error.log` - contains information related to nginx

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
```

console:
```
cat var/log/nginx/error.log
# empty if no error in nginx
# bad configuration will result errors in this file
```

#### access_log

`/var/log/nginx/access.log` - contains information related to clients which are connecting to the webserver.

#### pid

process id of the master process

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
pid /var/run/nginx/pid;   # process id of the master process
```
console:
```
cat /var/run/nginx/pid
ps -ef --forest | grep nginx
root  ... nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
nginx ... \_ nginx: worker process
nginx ... \_ nginx: worker process
```

### S04/L20 NGINX Configuration - Events and HTTP (New)

#### events

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
events {
  worker_connections 1024;  # how many connections a worker can have
}
```

#### http

- **access_log** - The format is defined by `log_format`
  - IP address
  - timestamp
  - request type
  - response code
  - user agent
- **log_format** - uses variables e.g.:
  - $remote_add - IP of the client
  - etc.

```
# put error into file
service nginx restart
# error_log file changes

# test configuration file
nginx -t
```

### S04/L21 NGINX Configuration - Include directive (New)

#### include

Includes all the contents. Makes easier to read and debug the configuration.

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
```

### S04/L22 Creating Virtual Hosts in NGINX (New)

`/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` is the default page NginX shows.

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
```

`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`:
```
# change the port from 80 to 8080
# listen 80 default_server;
listen 8080 default_server;
# ...
root /usr/share/nginx/html;   # path of the index.html
```

console:
```
netstat -nltp
nginx -t
service nginx restart
# nginx listening on 8080

# change back to default configuration
```

`virtual.conf`:
```
server {
  listen        8080;                           # defines port where nginx listens on
  listen        somename:8080;
  server_name   somename alias another.alias;   # will be present in the hostname header of the client

  location / {
    root        html;                           # directory in which the website is stored
    index       index.html index.htm;           # first file found will be laded by default
  }
}
```

console:
```
cp virtual.conf kplabs.conf

# modify the file names to avoid loading them by the pattern
mv default.conf default.conf.bak
mv ssl.conf ssl.conf.bak
mv virtual.conf virtual.conf.bak

mkdir -p /var/www/websites
cd /var/www/websites
touch index.html

cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
nginx -t
service nginx restart
```

`kplabs.conf`:
```
server {
  listen        80;
  server_name   example.com;

  location / {
    root        /var/www/websites/;
    index       index.html index.htm;
  }
}
```

`/var/www/websites/index.html`:
```
Welcome to our first website based on nginx :)
```

- multiple server block can be defined in a configuration file

### S04/L23 MIME Types (New)

- **MIME** - Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions
  - Images
  - HTML files
  - Video files
  - Audio files
  - Documents
  - etc.
- Web Server also sends the MIME filetype when sends a file to a client
- Web browser might have certain type of extensions for MIME filetypes installed

```
curl -I https://www.sans.org/media/score/checklist/FirewallChecklist.pdf
# Content-Type: application/pdf

curl -I http://example.com/seed.jpg
# Content-Type: image/jpeg
```

- Content-Type header indicated the media type of a specific resource
  - application/pdf
  - text/html

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
default_type application/octet-stream;    # for files that don't meet the extensions from the included MIME types
```

**default_type application/octet-stream** - tells the browser to directly download it and not process it

`include /etc/nginx/mime.types`:
```
types {
  text/html   html htm shtml;
  image/jpeg  jpeg jpg;
  ...
  video/mp4   mp4;
  ...
}
```

console:
```
cat /etc/nginx/mime.types | grep octet-stream
# file types specific to operating systems

wget ftp://distro.ibiblio.com/pub/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/pcmciafloppy.img
mv pcmciafloppy.img test.img

curl -I http://example.com/test.img
# Content-Type: applicatiom/octet-stream
```

- Common MIME types (main_type/sub_type):
  - application/*
  - audio/*
  - image/*
  - text/*
  - video/*
